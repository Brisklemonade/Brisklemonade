🎓 High school Senior graduation date (May 2022)

🌇 I'm currently living in Dallas Texas, with a passion for creating we and native applications

📚 Since I was in sixth grade, I've been programming. My first big project on repl.it was a c++ RPG (role-playing game). It has over 2,000 lines of code and it was highly praised at my school. I spent a few years building things in python and c++, and while I was good at it and enjoyed it, it didn't feel like I had found my passion. In the last few months, I've become fascinated by the world of user interface design and all it has to offer. I taught myself how to become a UI Designer and landed a remote job as one. The idea of combining design and code came to me one day, and it was one of the best ideas I'd ever had. I believe I have discovered my passion, and I am excited to see where life will take me!

💻 As for the near future, I hope to one day work as a junior developer and work with a diverse high energy team focused on solving issues in creative ways.

🏔 I don't just spend all of my time coding though. I love to play games with my friends, cook, create videos for tik tok and many other things!

💪🏽 Some strengths of mine that I'd like to highlight are:

- My positive Attitude

- Great communication Skills

- Good Time and Task Management

- Quick Learning Ability

- A Good Team Player
